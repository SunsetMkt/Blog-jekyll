## To Whom I Have Never Met: A Disclaimer from Sunset

### Introduction

Dear Sir or Madam,

This document is a general and informal disclaimer (hereinafter referred to as the "Document" or other terms with a referential meaning). Given the special nature of your contact with Sunset (translated as "Sunset", if a third-person pronoun is needed, "they"), and considering your specific circumstances, you may receive this Document as a **routine reminder**. **This Document does not have any legal effect or binding force, and it serves only as a general statement with no directionality or universality. However, Sunset hopes that you can assist in implementing the content of this Document to the best of your ability.** We believe that mutual cooperation will create a win-win situation.

In case of any discrepancies between multiple language versions of this Document, the Simplified Chinese version shall prevail. This Document may be updated at any time, so please refer to Sunset's personal website for the latest content, without prior notice.

The last revision date of this Document is: 2024-06-02 UTC+9.

### Minors

This Document applies to natural persons with full civil capacity, who need to be at least 18 years old within the People's Republic of China. According to the laws and regulations of your location, the [specific age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_majority) may vary.

**If you are a minor, it may be more appropriate to read this Document with your legal guardian. Even if you may not want this to be known for various reasons, Sunset respects your wishes but still hopes you can fully read and understand the content of the Document.**

As a rule, minors require stricter protection in certain aspects, which will not be elaborated on here. Sunset has no obligation or ability to verify the user's age information and does not assume any legal responsibility for such reasons.

### Contact and Trust

You have established a deep and constructive connection with Sunset via the Internet. Unfortunately, you and Sunset have never met. This may be unpleasant but might be an inevitable choice for a long time.

**On the Internet, never having met inevitably means low credibility.** Please be clear: Sunset is not worthy of, nor does it need, your trust. **Excessive trust in anyone will put you in danger, without exception.** You have no responsibility or obligation to accept any requests from Sunset, nor should you put yourself in danger due to any request from Sunset.

Sunset does not recommend forming overly close bonds with anyone you meet on the Internet, nor does it suggest making such individuals your emotional support. **Healthy, mutually beneficial relationships are based on self-independence.**

### Information Transparency

**Sunset does not explicitly or implicitly guarantee the authenticity and/or accuracy of any personal information disclosed publicly and/or privately**, including but not limited to:

- Personal profile information in instant messaging software, social networks, forums, etc., whether public or hidden, including name, gender, date of birth, place of employment, etc.
- Any information provided on Sunset's personal website
- Any information inferred from Sunset's personal digital footprint (i.e., data traces left when using the Internet)

**Sunset will not correct any misunderstandings you may have about their personal information**, nor will they deliberately **explicitly** provide false personal information through communication (limited to purely textual or multimedia exchanges via instant messaging software or internal messaging). Intentional confusion regarding Sunset's personal information in public forums (such as chat groups provided by instant messaging software, forum comment sections, publicly published literature, etc., unless required by convention, academic requirements, or laws and regulations to be explicit) is even encouraged.

Sunset believes that for personal safety reasons, the information you expose on the Internet should be your disguise and protection rather than a true reflection of your personal status. Sunset encourages you to present false personal information to them.

Sunset will strive to ensure that the information they provide is true and reliable, **but for certain information that needs to be kept confidential for personal reasons, Sunset may provide ambiguous or completely false responses**. Sunset apologizes for such situations.

### Physical and Mental Health

Sunset believes that you have a clear understanding of "physical and mental health" and hopes you fully recognize the goal of "achieving physical and mental health."

**Sunset does not intend to support any behavior that causes temporary trauma to the body and strongly opposes behaviors that cause irreversible damage or even death.** Out of respect for your personality and considering specific circumstances, Sunset may not raise objections to the above behaviors. Due to practical factors, Sunset cannot provide assistance in any situation. Depending on the severity of the situation, Sunset reserves the right to report to relevant responsible institutions.

**Sunset cares deeply about your mental health but, due to personal reasons, finds it difficult to empathize with others, so cannot provide you with sufficient support.** For risk control reasons, Sunset may not intervene in your suspected or actual mental health problems, nor respond to any suspected or actual requests for help. Depending on the severity of the situation, Sunset reserves the right to report to relevant responsible institutions.

**Sunset is not qualified to provide medical advice.** The medical information provided by Sunset is at most a neutral summary and cannot replace the advice of healthcare professionals (such as qualified doctors, nurses, pharmacists, etc.). Sunset is not a doctor. None of Sunset's statements can be interpreted as attempting to give or provide specific medical opinions or as part of medical clinical practice.

**Sunset sincerely hopes that you can achieve or maintain physical and mental health as soon as possible.**

### Laws, Religion, and Politics

Sunset hopes that you will respect the laws and regulations of your location and does not intend to encourage you to violate laws and regulations.

Sunset fully respects your religious beliefs and political views but reserves the right to discuss and/or comment on them.

### Responsibilities and Obligations

**In most cases, Sunset will not disclose your personal information and/or communication content without your consent, nor will it publicly infer information from your publicly available digital footprint.**

Sunset will do its best to assist you in solving problems within its ability but will not assume any responsibility and/or losses (except in cases where other agreements or commitments may affect this clause).

**You have no responsibility and/or obligation to read, agree with, and/or comply with any terms of this Document.** You also do not need to inform Sunset of any decisions or guarantees regarding the fulfillment of this Document's terms. **Your safety outweighs all rules and/or agreements.**

### Transactions, Loans, and/or Donations

Matters involving transactions, loans, and/or donations should respect the laws and regulations of your location during implementation.

**To ensure the safety and reliability of transactions, loans, and/or donations, Sunset may intrusively or non-intrusively collect your personal information without notice, which is considered a risk control procedure similar to "Know Your Customer" (KYC).** Personal information collected for such reasons will not be disclosed or used for other purposes.

### Situations Affecting Document Implementation

**Sunset cannot oppose local law enforcement agencies and/or laws and regulations.** In case of requests and/or threats, Sunset may disclose your personal information to relevant entities. In such cases, you may not be notified of the event.

**Sunset will strive to ensure the security of media, devices, and third-party services storing sensitive information.** However, in extreme cases, they may still be attacked and result in data breaches. You will be notified of the loss assessment after the incident is resolved.

**For the sake of public interest**, Sunset may disclose part of your non-sensitive information after ethical review, without your consent and without prior notice.

**For suicide intervention purposes**, Sunset may disclose part of your sensitive information to trusted third parties after ethical review, without your consent and without prior notice.
