## To Whom I Have Never Met: A Disclaimer from Sunset

### Introduction

Hello, this is a general informal disclaimer _("the Document" or other terms of similar reference hereinafter)_. Due to the special nature of your relationship with Sunset _("Sunset," or "they" if third-person pronouns are necessary)_, and considering your specific circumstances, you may receive this Document as a **routine reminder**. **This Document does not have any legal effect and/or binding force in fact, and it serves as a general statement without specific direction or universality, but Sunset still hopes you can assist in implementing the contents of this Document to the extent possible.** We believe that joint efforts will create a win-win situation.

In case of any ambiguity in multiple language versions of this Document, the Simplified Chinese version shall prevail. This Document may be updated at any time; please check the relevant content on Sunset's personal website yourself, without further notice.

The last revision of this Document was on: 2024-05-14 UTC+9.

### Minors

This Document applies to natural persons with full civil capacity within the People's Republic of China. You need to be at least 18 years old. The [specific age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_majority) may vary depending on the laws and regulations of your location.

**If you are a minor, it may be more appropriate to read this Document in the company of your legal guardian. If you do not want them to know for various reasons, Sunset respects your wishes but still hopes you can fully read and understand the content of the Document.**

According to convention, minors require stricter protection in some aspects, which will not be elaborated here. Sunset has no obligation and is unable to verify the age information of users and does not assume legal responsibility for this reason.

### Contact and Trust

You and Sunset have established a deep and constructive relationship through the Internet. Unfortunately, you have never met Sunset. This may be unpleasant, but it might be an inevitable choice for a long time.

**On the Internet, never meeting in person inevitably means low credibility.** Please be clear: Sunset is neither worthy of nor needs your trust. **Excessive trust in anyone will put you in danger, without exception.** You have no responsibility and/or obligation to accept any requests from Sunset and should not put yourself in danger because of Sunset's requests.

Sunset does not recommend that you form overly close bonds with anyone you meet on the Internet, nor does it recommend making such people your emotional support. **Healthy and mutually beneficial relationships are based on self-independence.**

### Information Transparency

**Sunset does not explicitly or implicitly guarantee the authenticity and/or accuracy of any personal information disclosed publicly and/or privately,** including but not limited to:

- Personal profile information disclosed publicly or hidden on instant messaging software, social networks, forums, including name, gender, date of birth, workplace, etc.
- Any information provided on Sunset's personal website
- Any information inferred from Sunset's digital footprint _(i.e., the data traces left while using the Internet)_

**Sunset will not correct any misunderstanding you have about their personal information** and will not deliberately _misrepresent_ personal information through communication _(limited to text or multimedia communication based on instant messaging software or internal messages)_. In public places _(such as chat groups provided by instant messaging software, forum comment areas, publicly published literature, etc., which are not included due to conventions, academic requirements, or legal regulations that must be clarified)_, the deliberate confusion of Sunset's personal information is even encouraged.

Sunset believes that for the sake of personal safety, the information you expose on the Internet should serve as your disguise and protection, rather than a true reflection of your personal situation. Sunset encourages you to show false personal information to them.

Sunset will try to ensure the information provided is true and reliable, **but for some information that needs to be kept confidential for personal reasons, Sunset may provide ambiguous or completely incorrect responses.** Sunset apologizes for such situations.

### Physical and Mental Health

Sunset believes you have a clear understanding of "physical and mental health" and hopes you fully recognize the goal of "achieving physical and mental health."

**Sunset has no intention to support any behavior that causes temporary trauma to the body and strongly opposes behaviors that cause irreversible damage or even death.** Out of respect for your personality and considering specific circumstances, Sunset may not object to the above behaviors. Due to practical reasons, Sunset cannot provide assistance in any situation. Depending on the severity, Sunset still reserves the right to report to relevant responsible agencies.

**Sunset is very concerned about your mental health but finds it difficult to empathize with others due to personal reasons, so they cannot provide sufficient support.** For risk control reasons, Sunset may not intervene in your suspected or actual mental health issues, nor respond to any suspected or actual help requests. Depending on the severity, Sunset still reserves the right to report to relevant responsible agencies.

**Sunset is not qualified to provide medical advice.** The medical information provided by Sunset is at most a neutral summary and cannot replace the advice of medical professionals _(such as qualified physicians, nurses, pharmacists, etc.)_. Sunset is not a physician. Any statement by Sunset cannot be interpreted as attempting to give or provide specific medical advice or as part of medical clinical practice.

**Sunset sincerely hopes you can achieve or maintain physical and mental health as soon as possible.**

### Laws, Religion, and Politics

Sunset hopes you respect the laws and regulations of your location and has no intention of encouraging you to violate them.

Sunset fully respects your religious beliefs and political views but reserves the right to discuss and/or evaluate them.

### Responsibilities and Obligations

**In most cases, Sunset will not disclose your personal information and/or communication content without your consent, nor will they publicly disclose information inferred from your publicly available digital footprint.**

Sunset will try their best to assist you in solving problems within their capability but will not assume any responsibility and/or loss _(situations where other agreements or commitments that may affect this clause exist are not included)_.

**You have no responsibility and/or obligation to read, agree to, and/or comply with any terms of this Document.** You also do not need to inform Sunset of any decisions or guarantees regarding compliance with these terms. **Your safety is above all rules and/or agreements.**

### Transactions, Loans, and/or Donations

For matters involving transactions, loans, and/or donations, the implementation process should respect the laws and regulations of your location.

**To ensure the safety and reliability of transactions, loans, and/or donations, Sunset may intrusively or non-intrusively collect your personal information without further notice. This is considered a risk control procedure similar to "Know Your Customer" _(KYC)_.** Personal information collected for such reasons will not be publicly disclosed or used for other purposes.

### Situations Affecting the Implementation of the Document

**Sunset cannot counter local law enforcement agencies and/or laws and regulations.** Under the requirement and/or threat of relevant entities, Sunset may disclose your personal information. In such cases, you may not receive notice of this incident.

**Sunset will strive to ensure the security of the media, devices, and third-party services storing sensitive information.** However, in extreme cases, they may still be attacked, leading to data breaches. You will receive a notification regarding the loss assessment after the incident is handled.

**For the sake of public interest,** Sunset may disclose some of your non-sensitive information after ethical review, without your consent and without further notice.

**For the purpose of suicide intervention,** Sunset may disclose some of your sensitive information to trusted third parties after ethical review, without your consent and without further notice.
