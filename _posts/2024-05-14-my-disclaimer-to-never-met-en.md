## To Whom It May Concern: A Disclaimer from Sunset

### Introduction

Dear Sir/Madam,

This document is a general and informal disclaimer (hereinafter referred to as "the document" or other referential terms). Given the unique nature of your connection with Sunset (translated as "Sunset", referred to as "they" if third-person pronouns are needed), considering your specific situation, you may receive this document as a **routine reminder**. **This document has no legal effect or binding force, serves as a general statement, and is not directive or universal, but Sunset hopes you will assist in implementing the contents of this document to the extent possible.** We believe that collaboration will create a win-win situation.

If there are multiple language versions of the content of this document and any ambiguity arises, the Simplified Chinese version shall prevail. This document may be updated at any time; please refer to Sunset's personal website for relevant content without further notice.

The last revision date of this document is: 2024-06-02 UTC+9.

### Minors

This document applies to natural persons with full civil capacity, who need to be 18 years of age in the People's Republic of China. The [specific age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_majority) may vary according to the laws and regulations of your location.

**If you are a minor, it may be more appropriate to read this document in the company of your legal guardian. You may not want this to be known to them for various reasons; in such cases, Sunset respects your wishes but still hopes you can fully read and understand the contents of this document.**

As per convention, minors require stricter protection in some respects, which will not be detailed here. Sunset has no obligation or capability to verify the age information of users and does not assume any legal responsibility for issues arising from such reasons.

### Contact and Trust

You have established a profound and constructive relationship with Sunset via the Internet. Unfortunately, you have never met Sunset in person. This may be regrettable but is perhaps an inevitable choice for a long period of time.

**On the Internet, never having met in person necessarily implies low trustworthiness.** Please understand: Sunset is neither worthy of nor needs your trust. **Excessive trust in anyone will put you in danger, without exception.** You have no responsibility or obligation to accept any requests from Sunset, nor should you put yourself in danger due to any requests from Sunset.

Sunset does not recommend forming overly close ties with anyone you meet on the Internet, nor does Sunset recommend making such individuals your emotional support. **Healthy, mutually beneficial relationships are based on self-independence.**

### Information Transparency

**Sunset does not explicitly or implicitly guarantee the authenticity and/or accuracy of personal information disclosed publicly and/or privately,** including but not limited to:

- Personal profile information disclosed on instant messaging software, social networks, forums, etc., such as name, gender, date of birth, place of employment, etc.
- Any information provided on Sunset's personal website
- Any information inferred from Sunset's personal digital footprint (i.e., data traces left when using the Internet)

**Sunset will not correct any misunderstandings you may have about their personal information,** nor will Sunset deliberately _provide_ incorrect personal information through communication (limited to text or multimedia communication via instant messaging software or private messages). In public settings (such as chat groups provided by instant messaging software, forum comment sections, publicly published documents, etc., where convention, academic requirements, or legal regulations necessitate clarity), deliberate obfuscation of Sunset's personal information is even encouraged.

Sunset believes that for personal safety considerations, the information you expose on the Internet should serve as your disguise and protection, rather than a true reflection of your personal circumstances.

### Content Security

Unless otherwise stated, any information and/or content provided by the services do not constitute Sunset's formal advice, endorsement, or commitment. This does not exclude AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content), does not guarantee copyright issues, nor does it guarantee child safety ratings (such as ratings similar to those by the ESRB).

### GDPR

Unless otherwise stated, the services may not collect your personal information in compliance with the [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/), and do not explicitly provide services to EU users.

You may use [popular blockers](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) to prevent the services from collecting your personal information.

### Statistics and Telemetry

The services use multiple third-party services for access statistics and telemetry, which may unintentionally collect your personal information.

Information generated by you while using any service may be used for statistics and improving user experience without further notice.

### Interpretation of the Disclaimer

Sunset reserves the right to the final interpretation of this disclaimer. If any term of this document is found to be invalid or unenforceable, it does not affect the validity or enforceability of the other terms.

### Conclusion

Sunset appreciates your reading and understanding of this document. By clarifying the responsibilities and rights of both parties, we hope to establish a more transparent and safe communication environment in future interactions. Your safety and well-being are always our top concern.

If you have any questions or need further explanation, you can contact Sunset through appropriate channels, but please understand that any communication does not constitute a legal obligation or responsibility.

Sunset greatly values your acquaintance and has never doubted your sincerity.

Sunset wishes you all the best in your Internet usage.
