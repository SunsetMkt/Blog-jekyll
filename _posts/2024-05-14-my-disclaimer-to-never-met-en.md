## To Whom I Have Never Met: A Disclaimer from Sunset

English Translation by ChatGPT for reference only, 2024-05-14 version.

### Introduction

Hello, this is a general informal disclaimer _("Document", or other terms with similar reference meanings hereinafter)_. Due to the special nature of your connection with Sunset _("Sunset", translated as "余晖", and "they" if third-person pronouns must be used)_, considering your specific circumstances, you might receive this Document as a **routine reminder**. **This Document is, in fact, not legally binding or enforceable, and as a general statement, it is not directed or universal, but Sunset still hopes you can assist in implementing the contents of this Document within your capabilities.** We believe that joint efforts will lead to a win-win situation.

If there are multiple language versions of this Document, in case of any ambiguity, the Simplified Chinese version shall prevail. This Document may be updated at any time, so please check Sunset's personal website for relevant content, without further notice.

The last revision date of this Document is: 2024-05-14 UTC+9.

### Minors

This Document applies to natural persons with full civil capacity, in the People's Republic of China, requiring you to be at least 18 years old. Depending on the laws and regulations of your location, [the specific age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_majority) may vary.

**If you are a minor, it may be more appropriate to read this Document accompanied by your legal guardian. If for various reasons you do not wish this to be known to them, Sunset respects your wishes but still hopes you can fully read and understand the contents of this Document.**

As per customary practice, minors need stricter protection in certain aspects, which will not be detailed here. Sunset is not obligated and does not have the capacity to verify the age information of users and does not bear legal responsibility for such reasons.

### Contact and Trust

You and Sunset have established a deep and constructive connection through the Internet. Unfortunately, you have never met Sunset. This might be unpleasant, but it is perhaps an inevitable choice for a long period.

**On the Internet, having never met inevitably means low credibility.** Please be clear: Sunset is not worthy of, nor needs, your trust. **Excessive trust in anyone will put you in danger, without exception.** You have no responsibility or obligation to accept any request from Sunset, nor should you put yourself in danger because of any request from Sunset.

Sunset does not recommend that you form overly close ties with anyone you meet online, nor should you rely on such people for emotional support. **Healthy, win-win relationships are based on self-independence.**

### Information Transparency

**Sunset does not explicitly or implicitly guarantee the authenticity and/or accuracy of the personal information disclosed and/or provided in a private manner**, including but not limited to:

- Personal profile information in instant messaging software, social networks, forums, etc., including name, gender, birth date, work institution, etc.
- Any information provided on Sunset's personal website
- Any information inferred from Sunset's digital footprint _(i.e., data traces left when using the Internet)_

**Sunset will not correct your misunderstandings about their personal information**, nor will they deliberately provide false personal information through communication _(limited to text or multimedia communication via instant messaging software or internal messages)_. Deliberate confusion about Sunset's personal information in public settings _(e.g., chat groups provided by instant messaging software, forum comment sections, publicly published literature, etc., where clarity is required due to conventions, academic requirements, or legal regulations is not included)_ is even encouraged.

Sunset believes that for personal safety reasons, the information you expose on the Internet should be your disguise and protection, rather than a true reflection of your personal situation. Sunset encourages you to present untrue personal information to them.

Sunset will strive to ensure that the information they provide is true and reliable, **but for some information that needs to be kept confidential for personal reasons, Sunset may provide ambiguous or completely wrong responses**. Sunset apologizes for such situations.

### Physical and Mental Health

Sunset believes that you have a clear understanding of "physical and mental health" and hopes you fully recognize the goal of "achieving physical and mental health".

**Sunset has no intention of supporting any behavior that causes temporary physical trauma and strongly opposes behavior that causes irreversible damage or even death.** Out of respect for your personality and considering specific situations, Sunset may not object to the aforementioned behaviors. Due to practical reasons, Sunset cannot provide assistance in any circumstances. Depending on the severity of the situation, Sunset reserves the right to report to relevant authorities.

**Sunset cares deeply about your mental health but is limited in empathizing with others due to personal reasons, so they cannot provide sufficient support.** For risk control reasons, Sunset may not intervene in your suspected or actual mental health issues, nor will they respond to any suspected or actual help requests. Depending on the severity of the situation, Sunset reserves the right to report to relevant authorities.

**Sunset is not qualified to provide medical advice.** The medical information provided by Sunset is at most a neutral summary and cannot replace the advice of medical professionals _(e.g., qualified doctors, nurses, pharmacists, etc.)_. Sunset is not a doctor. Any statements made by Sunset should not be interpreted as attempting to give or provide specific medical advice, nor are they part of clinical medical practice.

**Sunset sincerely hopes that you can achieve or maintain physical and mental health as soon as possible.**

### Laws, Religion, and Politics

Sunset hopes that you can respect the laws and regulations of your location and does not encourage you to violate them.

Sunset fully respects your religious beliefs and political views but reserves the right to discuss and/or evaluate them.

### Responsibilities and Obligations

**In most cases, Sunset will not disclose your personal information and/or communication content without your consent, nor will they publicly disclose information inferred from your disclosed digital footprint.**

Sunset will do their best within their capabilities to assist you in solving problems but will not assume any responsibility and/or losses _(situations involving other agreements or commitments affecting this clause are not included)_.

**You have no responsibility and/or obligation to read, agree with, and/or comply with any terms of this Document.** You also do not need to inform Sunset of any decisions or guarantees regarding compliance with this Document. **Your safety takes precedence over all rules and/or agreements.**

### Transactions, Loans, and/or Donations

For matters involving transactions, loans, and/or donations, the implementation process should respect the laws and regulations of your location.

**To ensure the safety and reliability of transactions, loans, and/or donations, Sunset may intrusively or non-intrusively collect your personal information without further notice, considered a "Know Your Customer" _(KYC)_ risk control procedure.** Personal information collected for such reasons will not be publicly disclosed or used for other purposes.

### Situations Affecting the Implementation of the Document

**Sunset cannot resist local law enforcement agencies and/or laws and regulations.** When required and/or threatened, Sunset may disclose your personal information to relevant entities. In such cases, you may not receive notice of this event.

**Sunset will strive to ensure the security of media, devices, and third-party services storing sensitive information.** However, in extreme cases, they may still be attacked, leading to data breaches. You will be notified of the loss assessment after the incident is handled.
