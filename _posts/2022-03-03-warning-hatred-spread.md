这是一个警告。

由于近期的战争，一些国家正在被某些集团“制裁”。

然而我们需要注意，那些国家的民众绝对没有“可恶”到应当“制裁”。政治是肮脏的，人类还不是。

由于经济、历史、政治等多重原因，仇恨正在人类间传播。

这些仇恨有针对国外民众的，也有针对国内民众的。

这种现象并非近期产生，但愈演愈烈。

人类，极有可能面临自己种族的生存危机。

### ？？？

我时常会想，为什么我们不将一切阻碍人类发展的行为定义为“反人类”呢？

我们时常会有“集体荣誉感”、“爱国情怀”，但很少有作为同一物种的“凝聚力”。

总有人类想着获得更高的支配地位、总有人类想着挤占他人的生存空间、总有人类尝试控制人类发展的历程、总有人类在拖整个物种的后腿。

但我们仍然只是一盘散沙，盯着自己食盆中的食物惶惶不可终日。

## Translation

This is a warning.

Due to recent wars, some countries are being "sanctioned" by certain groups.

However, we need to pay attention that the people of those countries are absolutely not "abominable" enough to be "sanctioned". Politics is dirty, and humans are not yet.

Hatred is spreading among human beings due to economic, historical, political and other reasons.

These hatreds are aimed at foreigners as well as domestic people.

This phenomenon is not recent, but it is getting worse.

Human beings are very likely to face the existential crisis of their own species.

### ? ? ?

I often wonder, why don't we define anything that hinders human development as "anti-human"?

We often have a "collective sense of honor" and "patriotism", but rarely the "cohesion" of the same species.

There are always humans who want to gain a higher dominance, there are always humans who want to squeeze the living space of others, there are always humans trying to control the course of human development, there are always humans who are dragging down the entire species.

But we are still just a plate of loose sand, staring at the food in our food bowl all day long.
