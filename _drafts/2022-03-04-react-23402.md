React 项目俄罗斯开发者 dan（gaearon）关于支持乌克兰标语的回应

[来源：React 仓库 23402 号 issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/23402)

Hi there.

你好。

People in Ukraine are in the middle of a severe humanitarian crisis. According to UN, a million of people have become refugees this week. It is widely reported that many people, including kids, are sheltering in basements, traveling in freezing temperatures, and are short on supplies. This is why we would like to encourage everyone using React to help those in need.

乌克兰人民正处于严重的人道主义危机之中。据联合国称，本周有一百万人成为难民。据广泛报道，包括儿童在内的许多人都躲在地下室，在寒冷中流浪，并且缺乏补给。这就是为什么我们要鼓励每个使用 React 的人来帮助那些需要帮助的人。

It is true that we have not responded to every humanitarian disaster. There is no single objective threshold of scale, and we’ve only started doing these banners recently. However, this is not a zero-sum activity. First, we are only a single project, and there are other projects which may choose different causes (or not support any causes at all). Second, getting the message out about one crisis does not hurt people affected by a different crisis. This is why the “whataboutism” is mostly a distraction, and we will not spend time seriously entertaining it.

诚然，我们并未对每一场人道主义灾难作出反应。这没有单一客观的条件，我们最近才开始做这些横幅。但是，这不是零和活动。首先，我们只是一个项目，还有其他项目可能会选择支持不同的对象（或根本不支持任何一方）。其次，传达关于一场危机的信息不会伤害受另一场危机影响的人。这就是为什么“那么其他的战争呢？”主要是一种干扰，我们不会花时间认真地取悦它。

The Meta Open Source teams have collectively taken a stance in supporting humanitarian aid to Ukraine. The React team supports this stance. You are free to suggest other causes to support in the future. However, spamming the repo with duplicate issues and comments is disruptive. This violates the GitHub the terms of service, and GitHub will be removing this type of content. There is nothing more we would like to say on this at this point, so we will be locking this issue.

Meta 开源团队共同采取了支持对乌克兰的人道主义援助的立场。 React 团队支持这种立场。您可以自由地建议将来支持的其他对象。然而，用重复的问题和评论向仓库发送垃圾信息是破坏性的。这违反了 GitHub 的服务条款，GitHub 将删除此类内容。在这一点上，我们没有什么想说的了，所以我们将锁定这个 issue。

Thank you!

谢谢！
